            TABLE OF CONTENTS BELONGS RIGHT HERE!
 

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION

This document describes a Software Toolkit for the Polaroid Digital Palette 
Filmprinter.  Currently there are several configurations of the Toolkit 
that are distributed:

    --CPU--     --OS--    --Interface--     -- C Compiler -------
    IBM-PC      MS-DOS      Centronics      Microsoft C,  ver 5.1
    IBM-PC      MS-DOS      SCSI            Microsoft C,  ver 5.1
    MACINTOSH   MAC-OS      SCSI            Lightspeed C, ver 3.01

There will undoubtedly be even more configurations distributed in the
future.  Consult the READ.ME files on your diskette to see which
configuration you have.  This document applies to all distributed
configurations.  There may be special notes particular to a specific
configuration in the READ.ME files.

The Toolkit provides a simple, consistent software interface to the
Digital Palette filmprinter.  The interface consists of six C
functions and a single data structure.  It is written in "vanilla" C
and distributed in both source and object form.  Some configurations
may have small amounts of assembly language. You are encouraged to
take the source code and use it yourself or link it with your code
and distribute it to others.


MODIFIABLE OPERATING SYSTEM DEPENDENT UTILITIES


Don't be intimidated by the size of this document.  You can develop a
simple driver by writing less than 50 lines of C code and you
probably won't ever look at 80% of this document.

The Toolkit is full featured.  Every feature (and there are a lot of
them) of the Digital Palette can be controlled through the Toolkit
interface, but only if you want to use them.

Who should use the Toolkit?
    Independent Software Vendors wishing to write a Digital Palette driver 
    for their application.

    OEM users of the Digital Palette writing custom applications.

    End Users of the Digital Palette who have a non-standard image file 
    format that can't be read and printed by the normal application 
    programs distributed with the Digital Palette.

How do you use the Toolkit?

    If your application's environment matches one of the distributed 
    configurations:
        Write your driver which makes calls to some of the six  
        Toolkit functions and link it with the supplied object files.

    If your application's environment matches one of the distributed 
    configurations EXCEPT FOR THE C Compiler:
        Recompile (and possibly reassemble) the Toolkit.
        Write your driver which makes calls to some of the six  
        Toolkit functions and link it with the recompiled Toolkit   
        object files.

    If you application environment doesn't match one of the distributed 
    configurations:
        You have to "port" the Toolkit source to your new environment.
        This is the only instance when you actually have to look at the 
        source of the Toolkit.  Pick the configuration that is closest to 
        yours and dive in.  The Toolkit internals for the various
        configurations may very well be different.  The Toolkit is
        designed with as few operating system dependencies as possible.
        You should refer to the section at the end of this document
        called Modifiable Operating System Dependants Utilities.  There 
        is no use of stdin or stdout. Your changes will probably be
        confined to the "low end" of the Toolkit where actual IO to
        the film printer takes place.  The internals of the various
        configurations ARE NOT described in this document.  You must
        examine the code.  Contact Polaroid for any assistance you may
        need.


Related Documents

The Toolkit should have been distributed with some additional documents:

    Digital Palette, Product Specification
        This describes the generic behavior of a Digital Palette without
        regard to the communication interface, e.g. Centronics or SCSI.

    Digital Palette, Parallel Port Interface Specification
    Digital Palette/SCSI Interface Specifications
        These documents describe the specific behavior of a Digital 
        Palette with the given communication interface.

You will probably want to at least skim the Digital Palette, Product 
Specification.  Unless you are porting the Toolkit, you shouldn't need 
either the Parallel Port (Centronics) or SCSI Interface Specifications.

It should be noted that every "input parameter" of the Digital Palette is 
described in at least four places:

    This document           Describes how to set the parameter using 
                            the Toolkit interface and a brief   
                            description of its effect on the
                            Digital Palette.

    Product Spec            Describes its effect on the Digital

    Parallel Port Interface Spec
                            Describes how to get the parameter from
                            the host computer into the Digital 
                            Palette and duplicates its description 
                            from the Product Spec.

Unfortunately the names of a given parameter will be slightly different 
depending on which document you look in.  As an example, the table below 
gives the names used to set the Horizontal Resolution of the Digital 
Palette:

    This document               DP_HOR_RES(dp)
                 
    Product Spec                Resolutions, Horizontal
                                        
    SCSI Interface Spec         Mode Select, Horizontal Resolution
            
    Parallel Port Interface Spec    Set Horizontal Resolution
    
They all refer to the same entity.

==============================================================================

HOW DO I WRITE A DRIVER?

You should:
    Read the Introduction of this document if you haven't already done so.

    Read this section.

    Read the "read.me" file in the "samples" subdirectory on your Toolkit 
    Distribution Disk.

    Run some of the programs in the "samples" subdirectory on your Toolkit 
    Distribution Disk.

    Look at the source code of some of the sample programs.

    Copy a sample program (apic.c is a good choice) and modify it for your
    needs.

You should probably start simple. In particular, start using default 
parameters and let the Toolkit do all the work.  If you follow this 
approach, your driver should be taking pictures on the Digital Palette 
within a day.

This simple approach won't be satisfactory of course.  You will have to 
modify it, but get something simple working first.  Most of your work will 
be in the user interface, e.g. how to present parameters to the user so 
that they can be changed.  Other issues are described in the "Decisions you 
will have to Make" section at the end of this chapter.



GENERAL DESCRIPTION of the Toolkit:

There are six C functions available in the Toolkit.  They are described in 
detail in the "Digital Palette Toolkit Interface Functions".  This chapter 
will provide an overview of how to use the functions.  The functions are:

    DP_InitPrinter()      You have to call this function once at the
                        beginning of your program.  It initializes the
                        Toolkit code, initializes the Digital Palette,
                        and establishes default parameter settings.

    DP_StartExposure()    You have to call this function before the start of
                        every picture.

    DP_SendImageData()    This function delivers a line of pixel data to be 
                        printed.

    DP_TerminateExposure()  You have to call this function at the end of 
                          every picture.

    DP_SendPrinterParams()  You use this if you want to alter any of the 
                          default parameter settings.

    DP_GetPrinterStatus()   You use this if you want to monitor the status of
                          the Digital Palette.


All of the functions make use of a common data structure, DP_DATA, which is 
defined in "dpalette.h".  All of the parameters that are sent to the 
Digital Palette and all status information read from the Digital Palette 
are stored in this data structure.

A number of macros are defined which allow you to reference data in a 
DP_DATA structure.  All of the macros are defined in "dpalette.h" and are 
documented in detail in the "Toolkit Macros" chapter.




A SIMPLE EXAMPLE, using all default parameters:

The C code fragments below represents the simplest driver you could write.  
It omits the function parameters and ignores error conditions, but does 
show you the required flow of control.  It takes a single picture and 
exits.

    #include "dpalette.h"       /* Req'd for Toolkit definitions */

    main()
    {
        DP_InitPrinter(...)     /* Init the hardware and initialize
                                 to default parameters */

        DP_StartExposure(...)   /* Start a new picture */


        /* Loop over every line of every color in the image */
        for ( color = 0 ; color < NUM_USER_COLORS ; color++ )
        {   for ( line=0 ; line < ...# lines in image.. ; line++ )
            {   .......     /* Get a line of pixel data ready to
                               send to the printer. */

                /* Send line of data to film printer */
                DP_SendImageData( ...color...line... pixel_data) ;
            }
        }

        DP_TerminateExposure(....)      /* End of picture */

    }

The hard work for you is preparing a line of data to send to the film 
printer.  If you are exposing a 2048 line image, you need to present the 
DP_SendImageData() function with a pointer to 2048 bytes of memory which 
hold the pixels for that line.  The Digital Palette operates in a RED, 
GREEN, and BLUE color space.  You must send all of the RED, GREEN, and BLUE 
pixels separately (that is the purpose of the outermost "for" statement).
The DP_SendImageData() function will encode and transmit those pixels to 
the film printer.  The constant NUM_USER_COLORS is #defined to be 3 in 
"dpalette.h".

A SIMPLE EXAMPLE, changing some parameters 

The program in the prior section is expanded to change the resolution of 
the film printer.  Actual function arguments are supplied.  This code still 
ignores error conditions; the next section won't.

    #include "dpalette.h"       /* Req'd for Toolkit definitions */

    main()
    {   /* Declarations */
        DP_DATA our_dp ;        /* Allocate storage for DP_DATA */
        DP_DATA *dp = &our_dp ; /* and make a pointer to it */

        int color, line ;       /* Index'es */
        char pixel_buf[1024] ;  /* Where you build up lines to expose */

        /* Execution starts here */
        DP_InitPrinter(dp, SUPPRESS_BUFFER_WARNING, 0) ;
                            /* Init the hardware and set default
                               parameters in our DP_DATA */

        DP_HOR_RES(dp) = 1024 ; /* Change picture size in our local copy
                               of DP_DATA */
        DP_SendPrinterParams(dp) ; /* and send it to Digital Palette */


        DP_StartExposure(dp) ;  /* Start a new picture */


        /* Loop over every line of every color in the image */
        for ( color = 0 ; color < NUM_USER_COLORS ; color++ )
        {   for ( line=0 ; line < 1024 ; line++ )
            {   .......     /* Get a line of pixel data ready to
                               send to the printer.  Put it in
                               pixel_buf */

                /* Send line of data to film printer */
                DP_SendImageData(dp, line, pixel_buf, 1024, color) ;
            }
        }

        DP_TerminateExposure(dp, END_OF_EXPOSURE) ; /* End of picture */

    }


Notice that all of the Toolkit function take a "dp" argument.  This is a 
pointer to a DP_DATA structure which you must provide storage for.  There 
is no "memory" inside the Toolkit functions themselves.  They all keep 
everything they need to know inside the DP_DATA structure.

The DP_DATA structure also has a copy of all of the Digital Palette 
parameters.  Default values for these parameters are written into the 
DP_DATA structure by the DP_InitPrinter() function.

In this example, the user wanted to change the Horizontal Resolution.
The following line changes the value inside of the DP_DATA structure pointed 
to by "dp"

    DP_HOR_RES(dp) = 1024 ;

This C macro is defined inside of "dpalette.h".  There is a similar C macro 
defined for every parameter stored in a DP_DATA structure.  You can read or 
write this value.

Remember that the DP_HOR_RES(dp) only changes the copy of the parameter in 
memory.  You must a call to DP_SendPrinterParams() to force the Toolkit to 
send the parameters from the DP_DATA structure to the film printer.

Note that each call to DP_SendPrinterParams() will send ALL the parameters 
in the DP_DATA structure to the filmprinter.  It is recommended, therefore, 
that you modify all the parameters you want to change in the DP_DATA 
structure and make a single call to DP_SendPrinterParams().

Status information from the Digital Palette is also stored in DP_DATA.  For 
example, DP_CAMERADESCRIPTION(dp) would return a string describing the type 
of camera currently attached to the Digital Palette.  This is a read-only 
string.  The detailed documentation for the macros lists whether it refers 
to a parameter (READ/WRITE) or a status item (READ ONLY).

Most of the Toolkit functions update some of the status items in a DP_DATA 
structure.  The detailed function description will tell you exactly which 
status items in DP_DATA are updated by each function call.

You can force the update of some or all of the status items by making a 
call to DP_GetPrinterStatus().

A SIMPLE EXAMPLE, with proper error handling

In the interest of simplicity, the previous examples omitted any error 
handling.  This is a very, very bad idea.

Each of the Toolkit functions returns non-zero to indicate an error.  
Everytime you call a Toolkit function, YOU MUST CHECK ITS ERROR RETURN.

The following C code fragment illustrates an elegant way to deal with 
errors.

    if ( DP_SendPrinterParams(dp) )
    {   /* We got an error sending parameters to the film printer.
           DP_ERRORMESSAGE(dp) has a string which we need to present to
           the user.  We will do that and exit */
        printf ("%s\n", DP_ERRORMESSAGE(dp) ) ;
        exit(1) ;
    }

The Toolkit functions will detect any kind of error; clear it; provide you
a string describing the error in DP_ERRORMESSAGE(dp); and take a non-zero 
return.  It is your responsibility to get the error message to the user.  
The value last returned by a Toolkit function is kept in the DP_DATA 
structure.  You can reference it by DP_ERRORCLASS(dp).

Almost all of the errors are fatal.  You should present the error message 
to the user and give up on the current exposure.  If you want to try to 
take another picture, you must start over with DP_StartExposure() and 
DP_SendPrinterParams().

The functions return Negative Numbers to indicate a Fatal Error.  There is 
a complete list of all possible error returns in the "Error and Warning 
Descriptions" section.  Examples of fatal errors:

    Camera ran out of film.
    Film Printer is powered off.
    You supplied a bad value for a parameter,
        e.g. Horizontal Resolution = 100000.
    Film Printer is broken, it failed its internal self-test diagnostics.



Some of the errors are considered warnings.  A function returns a Positive 
Number to indicate a Warning.  Warnings indicate something has happened 
which your application should probably deal with.  There is a complete list 
of all Warnings in the "Error and Warning Descriptions" section.  A 
description of how you should handle each warning is found in the "Handling 
Errors and Warnings" section.  Examples of warnings are:

    Remove Film Warning 
                    There is a piece of partially exposed film in
                    the camera left over from a prior exposure.
                    You only get this when the Digital Palette can't 
                    advance the film in the camera (A Pack Back or 
                    4x5 Back is attached).

    Exposure Active Warning
                    You can't start another picture yet because there 
                    is a prior exposure in process. You only get this 
                    when the Digital Palette can't advance the film in 
                    the camera (A Pack Back or 4x5 Back is attached).

    
 
For the first cut of your driver, you should probably treat warnings as 
fatal.  Once you are taking pictures successfully, you should then modify 
the driver to handle warnings.

DOING TWO THINGS AT ONCE

The prior examples only did "one thing at a time".  When a call was made 
into the Toolkit, the function didn't return until it finished sending all 
of the data to the film printer.  If the film printer couldn't take data, 
the Toolkit function waited (by polling the film printer) until the film 
printer was ready, sent the data and returned.

There are two conditions when the film printer can't accept data:
    The film printer's internal buffer is full because you are sending 
    pixel data to the film printer faster than the film printer can expose 
    the data on film.

    There is a prior exposure in process with a manual camera back (Pack 
    or 4x5) attached. You can't start a new exposure until the user has 
    pulled the film from the current exposure.

There are times when you might want your program to do something
while waiting for the film printer to accept data.  You might want to
be preparing the next line of pixel data to send while waiting for
the last line to be transmitted.  You might want to update a status
line on the screen while waiting for an exposure to complete.

Setting DP_WAITFORBUFFER(dp) to SHOW_BUFFER_WARNINGS in the DP_DATA 
structure causes the Toolkit functions to immediately return if they can't 
send data to the film printer.  They will return some warning value (a 
positive number) to inform you that they DID NOT complete and to tell you 
why.  It is your responsibility to continue making calls to the function 
until it returns successfully.

DECISIONS YOU WILL HAVE TO MAKE:


What controls do you present to the user?

    There are a lot of parameters available for controlling the Digital 
    Palette.  You need to decide which ones to let the user change.
    Polaroid would suggest the following as a minimum:
        Horizontal Resolution
        Film Type
        Some kind of exposure control so they can adjust the color 
            balance and brightness of the image

How do I keep circles from turning into ovals?

    Please read the Aspect Ratio Chapter of the "Digital Palette Product 
    Specification".  It tells you how to choose the vertical resolution to 
    preserve aspect ratio.

    That chapter also gives the exact algorithm for setting all the required 
    Digital Palette parameters if you are printing a pure bitmap image.


How and when do I render data?

    The most obvious solution is to render a single line of data and send 
    it to the film printer.  This approach minimizes the amount of storage 
    required in the host computer because you only have to store one line 
    of data.  This approach also minimizes the total exposure time because 
    the film printer is actually exposing prior lines while you are 
    rendering the current line.  The only time this technique won't work 
    is if it takes you more than 50 milliseconds to render a line of 
    data.  If there is more than 50 milliseconds between lines of data,
    artifacts will show up on film. [See the Exposure Rate Control chapter 
    of the Digital Palette Product Specification.]



    If it takes you more than 50 milliseconds to render a line of data,
    you need to completely render a color and store it someplace, either 
    in memory or on disk.  Once the color is completely rendered, you 
    deliver it to the film printer directly from the temporary storage.
    This technique won't cause artifacts on film, but it does increase 
    your total exposure time.

    If you can "multi-task", you can shorten the total exposure time by 
    rendering the current color to temporary storage while you are 
    delivering the prior color to the film printer from another temporary 
    storage area.  This can even be accomplished under MS-DOS by using the
    judicious use of SHOW_BUFFER_WARNINGS.

What format of pixel data should I use?

    The film printer handles two formats of data:
        RGB         Raw 8 bit pixels
        RLE         Run-Length Encoded Data.

    By default, the Toolkit expects RGB data.  It converts it to RLE and 
    sends it to the film printer.

    By appropriately setting IMAGE_COMPRESSION(dp), you can cause the 
    Toolkit to expect RGB data and send it to the film printer as RGB.
    This is appropriate for "scanned images" as they don't compress very 
    well and the Toolkit will spend more time converting from RGB to RLE
    than is saved in the normal reduced transmission time of RLE.

    If the source of the image to be printed is already run-length encoded 
    in some fashion, you might want to convert to Digital Palette RLE 
    format yourself. You would set IMAGE_COMPRESSION(dp) appropriately to 
    tell the Toolkit that the pixel data is already in RLE format and 
    should be sent as is.

What if my application driver architecture won't let the user change
any parameters?

    All of the default parameters are stored in a "configuration
    file" on disk.  The DP_InitPrinter() function locates that
    configuration file, reads it, and sets all of the parameters in
    the DP_DATA structure accordingly.

    If you can't change parameters in the driver because your
    application won't let a driver "talk" to the screen/keyboard, you
    need to provide a way for the user to alter the "configuration
    file". 

    The best way, if possible, is to "shell out" of the driver and
    let the user run a program which modifies the configuration file.
    After the configuration file is modified, the user "exits" back
    to the driver which reads the configuration file and uses its
    parameter settings.

    Depending on which operating system your Toolkit is designed
    for, there may be a standalone program included with your Toolkit which
    modifies the configuration file.  Check the read.me files on the Toolkit
    diskette.  If one isn't included, contact Polaroid; we can either supply
    you with one or assist you in writing one.

    If it is impossible to "shell out" of the driver and into the operating
    system, then the user is forced to pick their operating parameters BEFORE
    STARTING the application. He should then modify the configuration file 
    as above, and then start the application.  This is obviously inferior.  
    If they change their minds after starting the application, they have to
    exit the application, change the configuration file, and restart
    the application.

TOOLKIT DATA STRUCTURE: DP_DATA

   All Toolkit routines require access to a common data structure.  An address
   to this structure, which is TYPEDEF'd in the DPALETTE.H include file as
   DP_DATA, is passed as an argument to all Toolkit function calls.  It is
   the responsibility of the calling application to declare this structure.

   The DP_DATA structure contains Digital Palette status information, data
   used as parameters to various Digital Palette commands, as well as data
   which is used by the Toolkit subroutines to control and monitor the status
   of the interface between the application and the Digital Palette.

   Polaroid Corporation expects that the format and contents of these data
   structures will change in future enhancements to this Toolkit.  Macros are
   defined in DPALETTE.H to refer to all structure members and should be
   used instead of referring to a structure member directly by name.

   See the Toolkit Data Structure Macros section in this document for more
   information.

==============================================================================

TOOLKIT INTERFACE FUNCTIONS

   There are six Toolkit functions which are available for an application to
   call.  The source code for each of these functions is contained on the
   Toolkit diskette which was distributed along with this document.

      DP_InitPrinter()       Reads the configuration file to obtain user
                             specified defaults, initializes the Digital
                             Palette, and sends all user specified defaults
                             to the Digital Palette.

      DP_SendPrinterParams() Sends exposure control parameters to the
                             Digital Palette.

      DP_StartExposure()     Tells the Digital Palette to prepare to receive
                             image data for a new exposure.

      DP_SendImageData()     Sends image data to the Digital Palette.

      DP_TerminateExposure() Tells the Digital Palette that the exposure is
                             complete.

      DP_GetPrinterStatus()  Obtains information about the Digital Palette
                             and its current status.



   Included on the Toolkit diskette are sample applications which use these
   Toolkit functions.  You are encouraged to review these samples before
   attempting your first Digital Palette application in order to understand
   the various ways in which the Toolkit routines can be called.

 DP_InitPrinter()

     Summary:

         #include "dpalette.h"
         int DP_InitPrinter(DP_DATA *dp, char wait, int port)

       Input:

         DP_DATA    *dp    Pointer to Digital Palette Toolkit data structure
                           which is defined in the DPALETTE.H include file.
         char       wait   Sets DP_WAITFORBUFFER flag.  Possible values for
                           this argument should be one of the following values
                           which are symbolically defined in the DPALETTE.H
                           include file:
                                SUPPRESS_BUFFER_WARNING 
                                SHOW_BUFFER_WARNING
                           See the Buffer Warning Suppression and Error and
                           Warning Description sections in this document for
                           information about the usage of this argument.
                           If in doubt, set it to SUPPRESS_BUFFER_WARNING!
         int        port      Indicates where and/or how to locate a Digital
                           Palette.  The Centronics parallel port version and
                           the SCSI version differ slightly in the possible
                           values and usage of this parameter.
                           CENTRONICS:  If zero, the port number saved in the
                              configuration file is used as the interface port
                              to the Digital Palette.  If non-zero, this
                              parameter specifies which port is to be used to
                              communicate with the Digital Palette.
                           SCSI:  This parameter specifies which SCSI ID to 
                              use in order to locate a Digital Palette.
                              Typically the first time this function is called
                              this parameter should be zero in order to locate
                              the first Digital Palette on the bus.  To find
                              additional palettes on the SCSI bus, add 1 to
                              the last SCSI ID found and specify this new ID
                              as this parameter.  (Note:  Each Digital Palette
                              on the bus requires its own DP_DATA structure.)

ERROR HANDLING

Fatal Errors

A Fatal error is indicated when one of the Toolkit functions returns a
negative value. (The DP_ERRORCLASS macro holds the last value returned
by a Toolkit function):
    -1  LOGICERR        Synchronous/Logic Error
    -2  HARDWERR        Asynchronous/Hardware Error
    -3  TIMEOUT         Communications Error
    -4  DISCONNECTED    Communications Error
    -5  UNKNOWNPORT     Communications Error
    -6  CONFIGERR       Configuration File Error
    -7  DPTOOLKITERR    Toolkit Usage Error
The exact descriptions of the errors are listed in the next chapter.


All of the FATAL errors can be treated in the same fashion by your application
code:

    Show the user the error message pointed to by the DP_ERRORMESSAGE macro

    Allow the user to fix the problem (they should be able to figure out
    what to do from the error message)

    Allow them to CONTINUE.  You should call DP_InitPrinter() before trying
    to start another exposure.

    Allow them to EXIT the application.


Warnings:

A Warning is indicated when one of the Toolkit functions returns a
positive value. (The DP_ERRORCLASS macro holds the last value returned
by a Toolkit function):
     1  BUFFERWARNING   Buffer Unavailable Warning
     2  EXPOSUREACTIVE  Active Exposure Warning
     3  REMOVEFILM      Remove Film Warning
The exact descriptions of the warnings are listed in the next chapter.

A naive driver can treat a Warning just like a Fatal Error.  Your first
cut at a driver should probably do this.  If you have the DP_WAITFORBUFFER
macro flag set to SUPPRESS_BUFFER_WARNING (which a naive driver should do),
the only warning you will ever get is REMOVEFILM.  The only disadvantage
of treating this as a FATAL error is that there may be long pauses (with no
notification to the user) while a Toolkit function is waiting for an exposure
to complete.

To avoid these long pauses, set the DP_WAITFORBUFFER macro flag to
SHOW_BUFFER_WARNING.  You must then test the following functions for
an EXPOSUREACTIVE return and take the specified action:

        DP_InitPrinter()
        DP_StartExposure()
            Inform the user that an exposure is in process.
            Reissue the function call until it returns NOERROR.
            Tell the user to pull the film.
            Wait for confirmation from the user that the film was removed.


        DP_TerminateExposure()
            Two choices:
                Monitor the progress of the exposure via DP_GetPrinterStatus()
                Periodically give the user some feedback as to progress,
                    e.g. display the number of lines exposed
                When the exposure is complete, tell the user to pull the film.
                Wait for confirmation from the user that the film was removed.

                --or--
                Silently proceed.  If the user starts another exposure,
                the next DP_StartExposure() call will prevent them from
                proceeding until they have removed the film.

            The appropriate choice for you depends on your application.
            The second choice (Silently proceeding) is probably the
            superior choice.

Regardless of how you decide to deal with DP_TerminateExposure(), you MUST
treat DP_InitPrinter() and DP_StartExposure() as recommended above.  There
MAY BE an exposure in progress when your application is first started.

Don't forget that setting the DP_WAITFORBUFFER macro flag to
SHOW_BUFFER_WARNING affects DP_SendImageData() as well as the three functions
listed above.  Make sure that the DP_WAITFORBUFFER macro flag is set
to SUPPRESS_BUFFER_WARNING before a call to DP_SendImageData() unless you
are prepared to deal with the BUFFERWARNING return from DP_SendImageData() as
described in the next paragraphs.

The only other possible warning return is BUFFERWARNING. A
BUFFERWARNING return indicates that the internal film printer buffer
is currently full and cannot accept data. DP_SendImageData() is the
only function that will return BUFFERWARNING and only when the
DP_WAITFORBUFFER macro flag is set to SHOW_BUFFER_WARNING. 

You should only set DP_WAITFORBUFFER to SHOW_BUFFER_WARNING and test
the return of DP_SendImageData() if you want to do something (e.g. render
data) when the film printer buffer is full.  Remember that you must
reissue the DP_SendImageData() call when it returns BUFFERWARNING.  The pixel
data was not delivered to the film printer.

Otherwise, make sure that DP_WAITFORBUFFER is set to SUPPRESS_BUFFER_WARNING
for the DP_SendImageData() call and it won't return until the pixel data has
been delivered to the film printer.

You can monitor the exact "fullness" of the film printer's internal
buffer by the DP_FREE_BUFFER macro.

ERROR AND WARNING DESCRIPTIONS

   All Digital Palette Toolkit routines set a macro DP_ERRORCLASS to a 
   non-zero value on warnings or errors and zero for success.  This value 
   is also returned by all Toolkit functions.

   Upon return, the DP_DATA structure contains enough information for the
   calling routine to take any corrective action necessary.  Usually 
   corrective action includes showing the user an error message.  See the 
   section Error Handling section for how your code should behave when it
   gets these errors.

   Success:

     0  NOERROR

        The Digital Palette reports no errors.  The Toolkit function called
        completed successfully.

   Fatal Errors:

    -1  LOGICERR Synchronous/Logic Error:

         The Digital Palette has determined that the command sent to it cannot
         be executed.  If this error class is returned while sending an image
         for exposure the current exposure being sent is canceled.  Any
         previous exposures sent completely and residing in the Digital
         Palette buffer will continue unaffected.

         This is typically caused by a bug in the application program,
         e.g. selecting a Horizontal Resolution of 100000.

         There is a complete list of all possible LOGICERR error messages in
         the following documents:

            Digital Palette, Parallel Port Interface Specification
            Digital Palette/SCSI Interface Specifications


    -2  HARDWERR Asynchronous/Hardware Error:

         The Digital Palette has determined that an error has occurred which
         prevents exposures from continuing.  If this error class is returned
         then all exposures contained in the Digital Palette buffer are
         canceled.

         Typical examples are of HARDWERRs are:
            The camera is out of film
            The Film Printer is broken


         There is a complete list of all possible HARDWERR error messages in
         the following documents:

            Digital Palette, Parallel Port Interface Specification
            Digital Palette/SCSI Interface Specifications

    -3  TIMEOUT Communications Error:

         The Toolkit interface routines could not communicate with the Digital
         Palette within a reasonable amount of time.

         This is typically caused by:
            The Film Printer is powered off.
            The Film Printer is disconnected from the computer.
            The Film Printer is connected to a different port than is
                specified in the configuration file.
            

    -4  DISCONNECTED Communications Error:

         Centronics Meaning:

         The Parallel Port Select (SLCT) line is not asserted.  See the
         Hardware Interface Description section of the Digital Palette
         Parallel Port Interface Specifications for more information.

         This is typically caused by:
            The Film Printer is powered off.
            The Film Printer is disconnected from the computer.
            The Film Printer is connected to a different port than is
                specified in the configuration file.

    -5  UNKNOWNPORT Communications Error:

         Centronics Meaning:

         The Toolkit interface routines attempted to communicate with the
         Digital Palette through a parallel port which is not known to the
         operating system.

			SCSI Meaning:
			
			This error class is not supported by the SCSI interface.

    -6  CONFIGERR Configuration File Error:

         The Toolkit routine DP_InitPrinter() could not find the configuration
         file or an error occurred while trying to read the default parameters
         from the configuration file.

         Under MS-DOS, the configuration file is located by examining the
         environment variable DPALETTE.

    -7  DPTOOLKITERR Toolkit Usage Error:

         Ambiguous or invalid data prevented a Toolkit routine from 
         successfully completing.  There are currently two Toolkit routines 
         which can generate this type of error class.

         DP_SendImageData() will return this error if the Image Compression
         flag in the DP_DATA structure is unknown value.  See the section
         on Run Length Encoding in this document for more information.

         DP_TerminateExposure() will return this error if the termination
         method passed to it is unknown.  See the functional description of
         DP_TerminateExposure() for more information.

   Warnings:

     1  BUFFERWARNING Buffer Unavailable Warning:

         The Digital Palette has insufficient buffer space available to store
         the data to be transmitted to it.

         This warning is only returned by the DP_SendImageData() function.

         This warning is only returned when the DP_WAITFORBUFFER macro flag
         is set to SHOW_BUFFER_WARNING.

         If this value is returned, it means that the data has NOT
         been sent to the Digital Palette and the caller should try again.

     2  EXPOSUREACTIVE Active Exposure Warning:

         The Digital Palette is CURRENTLY EXPOSING an image and the attached
         camera back requires that the user manually remove the film when the
         exposure is complete.

         This warning can be returned from:
                DP_InitPrinter()
                DP_StartExposure()
                DP_TerminateExposure()

         This warning is only returned when the DP_WAITFORBUFFER macro flag
         is set to SHOW_BUFFER_WARNING.

         The application must monitor the progress of the exposure in process
         and prompt the user to remove the film when it is complete.  The
         application MUST NOT start another exposure until it has:
                1) Detected that the current exposure is complete via
                   calls to DP_GetPrinterStatus()
                2) Informed the user to pull the film
                3) Gotten positive feedback from the user that the film
                   was removed, e.g. 'Hit any key to continue.'

     3  REMOVEFILM Remove Film Warning:

         The Digital Palette HAS COMPLETED exposing an image and the
         attached camera back requires that the user manually remove the
         film before starting another exposure.

         This warning can be returned from:
                DP_InitPrinter()
                DP_StartExposure()
                DP_TerminateExposure()

         This warning is only returned when the DP_WAITFORBUFFER macro flag
         is set to SUPPRESS_BUFFER_WARNING.

         Before proceeding, the application must:
                1) Inform the user to pull the film.
                2) Gotten positive feedback from the user that the film
                   was removed, e.g. 'Hit any key to continue.'


==============================================================================

WARNING SUPPRESSION

    The setting of the DP_WAITFORBUFFER macro flag determines how the
    Toolkit behaves when the film printer can't accept data.

    Legal settings for the DP_WAITFORBUFFER macro flag are:
         SUPPRESS_BUFFER_WARNING
         SHOW_BUFFER_WARNING

    There are two instances when the film printer can't accept data:

        --The filmprinter's internal buffer is full--
                Affects:    DP_SendImageData()

                Behavior:
                    SUPPRESS_BUFFER_WARNING
                            Waits for buffer space to become available and
                            sends the pixel data to filmprinter.
                            Returns NOERROR.

                    SHOW_BUFFER_WARNING
                            Returns immediately with a BUFFERWARNING warning.
                            The pixel data has not been sent to the film
                            printer.


        --An exposure is in progress and there is a manual camera back--
        --attached which requires the user to manually remove the film--
                Affects:    DP_InitPrinter()
                            DP_StartExposure()
                            DP_TerminateExposure()

                Behavior:
                    SUPPRESS_BUFFER_WARNING
                        Waits for the exposure to complete and returns
                        a REMOVEFILM warning.
                            
                    SHOW_BUFFER_WARNING
                       DP_InitPrinter()
                       DP_StartExposure()
                          Returns immediately with an EXPOSUREACTIVE warning.
                          The exposure is still in process.  The functions
                          did not successfully complete.  They must be
                          reissued until they return NOERROR.

                        DP_TerminateExposure()
                          Returns immediately with an EXPOSUREACTIVE warning.
                          The exposure is still in process. The
                          DP_TerminateExposure() successfully completed.  It
                          must not be reissued.  The driver may elect to
                          monitor the status of the exposure with repeated
                          calls to DP_GetPrinterStatus() to determine when the
                          exposure is complete.


   The  DP_WAITFORBUFFER macro flag is set to the value of the third argument
   to the Toolkit routine DP_InitPrinter() which should be the first Toolkit
   routine called by any application. The DP_WAITFORBUFFER macro flag may be
   modified any time subsequent to calling DP_InitPrinter() without adverse
   effects.



==============================================================================

RUN LENGTH ENCODING

   The Digital Palette is capable of accepting image data as run length 
   encoded or uncompressed.

   The decision as to whether to send the image data run length encoded or not
   is for the most part dependent upon the complexity of the image.  For 
   instance, a line from simple business graphic bar chart usually has many
   adjacent pixels of the same value and would compress to a relatively small
   number of bytes.  The time saved in sending just a few bytes of image data
   justifies the computational cost of the compression.  An added benefit of
   sending the data as run length encoded is that, as compressed, the image
   data occupies much less buffer space within the Digital Palette.

   A line of image data which has few adjacent pixels of the same value will
   not compress much smaller than its original size.  The time saved in 
   sending a line from a complex image is not great and does not justify the 
   computational costs of compression.  Note that in the extreme, if the line 
   of image data has NO adjacent pixels of the same value, compression will 
   yield more data bytes than uncompressed!

   DP_SendImageData(), when called, will examine the Image Compression flag,
   DP_IMAGE_COMPRESSION, to determine how the caller wants the image data
   sent.  The DP_IMAGE_COMPRESSION flag has three possible values defined as
   follows:

      NON_RLE_SEND_AS_RLE
         The line of image data is uncompressed prior to calling 
         DP_SendImageData().  DP_SendImageData() will compress the data and 
         send it to the Digital Palette as run length encoded.

      NON_RLE
         The line of image data is uncompressed prior to calling 
         DP_SendImageData().  DP_SendImageData() will send it to the Digital 
         Palette uncompressed.

      RLE
        The line of image data is already compressed prior to calling 
        DP_SendImageData() and will be sent as run length encoded.  The
        application is responsible for insuring that the data is in the
        proper format.  See the "Action Commands" chapter of the
        "Digital Palette Product Specification" for a description of the
        required format for Run length Encoding.

==============================================================================

TOOLKIT MACROS BY CATEGORY

   This section describes the categories of DP_DATA structure macros.  A brief
   discussion of each category should provide an overview of the abilities an
   application has in controlling and monitoring the Toolkit routines, and by
   extension, the Digital Palette itself.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Toolkit/Digital Palette Interface Status

   Interface Status macros are helpful in discriminating between the different
   kinds of errors and warnings that the Toolkit functions can generate.  All
   of the values referenced by these macros should be considered READ ONLY
   by the application.  That is, they are purely status information which is
   returned by the Toolkit and should not be modified by the application.

   DP_ALL_OKAY               Indicates TRUE if the last Toolkit function
                             called executed without error.

   DP_CONFIGERROR            Indicates TRUE if DP_InitPrinter() failed to read
                             the configuration file correctly.

   DP_DPALETTE_INITIALIZED   Indicates TRUE if DP_InitPrinter() successfully
                             initialized the Digital Palette.

   DP_DPALETTE_ONLINE        Indicates TRUE if the Toolkit functions have
                             successfully communicated with the Digital
                             Palette.

   DP_ERROR                  Indicates TRUE if the last Toolkit function
                             called returned an ERROR.

   DP_ERRORCLASS             Indicates the return value of the last Toolkit
                             function called.

   DP_ERRORMESSAGE           ASCII string describing the DP_ERRORCLASS.

   DP_ERRORNUMBER            Code number associated with DP_ERRORMESSAGE.

   DP_PORTERROR              Indicates TRUE if the Toolkit functions have
                             had difficulty communicating with the Digital
                             Palette through the specified port.

   DP_PRINTERERROR           Indicates TRUE if an error condition exists in
                             the Digital Palette.

   DP_WARNING                Indicates TRUE if the last Toolkit function
                             called returned a WARNING.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Toolkit/Digital Palette Interface Control

   An application can use these Interface Control macros to control how
   the Toolkit functions communicate with the Digital Palette or to control
   how the Digital Palette processes data sent to it by the Toolkit functions.
   The values in this group are READ/WRITE; meaning they can be modified by
   the application.

   DP_EXP_BUFFER_USAGE       Controls how the Digital Palette stores and
                             executes commands in it's command buffer.

   DP_EXP_CALIBRATION        Controls how rigorously the Digital Palette
                             performs auto-calibration before an exposure.

   DP_EXP_IMAGE_USAGE        Controls how the Digital Palette stores and
                             processes image data.

   DP_IMAGE_COMPRESSION      Controls and specifies how an application's
                             image data is stored and sent to the Digital
                             Palette.

   DP_PORT                   Specifies the port through which the Toolkit
                             functions communicate with the Digital Palette.

   DP_SERVO_MODE             Controls the Digital Palette's adaptive exposure
                             rate.

   DP_WAITFORBUFFER          Controls Buffer Warning Suppression for any
                             Toolkit function call.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Digital Palette Status/Information

   The Status/Information macros describe hardware, firmware, options, and
   equipment installed in, or attached to the Digital Palette as well as the
   current operating status of the Digital Palette.  All of the macros in
   this group are READ ONLY.

   DP_AUTOADVANCE            Indicates TRUE if the film is loaded in a camera
                             back which automatically ejects or advances when
                             an exposure is complete.

   DP_BUFFERAVAILABLE        Indicates TRUE if the Digital Palette has enough
                             buffer space available to accommodate the longest
                             possible command sent to it.

   DP_CAMERABACK             Code number for the camera back which is attached
                             to the Digital Palette.

   DP_CAMERADESCRIPTION      ASCII string describing the camera back which is
                             attached to the Digital Palette.

                     This macro is like DP_COLOR_TABLE except that it
                     only specifies levels in the GREEN color table.

                     The GREEN color table is initialized to be linear
                     (ie. level 0 = 0, level 255 = 255) when DP_InitPrinter()
                     is called.

                     If this value is modified, an application needs to call
                     DP_SendPrinterParams() before the start of the next
                     exposure in order for the change to take effect.

                     This value is read in from the configuration file.
                     
                     Normally, this value is modified in conjunction with
                     these other Macros:  DP_HOR_RES, DP_LINE_LENGTH,
                     DP_HOR_OFFSET, DP_VER_HEIGHT, DP_VER_OFFSET.

                     If this value is modified, an application needs to call
                     DP_SendPrinterParams() before the start of the next
                     exposure in order for the change to take effect.

 DP_GetConfigPath()

     Summary:

         char *DP_GetConfigPath(void)

      DP_GetConfigPath() calls the C function getenv() to obtain the
   environment variable DPALETTE from DOS.  If the environment variable is
   unavailable, for instance if your application does not retain the PSP, you
   should modify this routine to get the path/filename of the configuration
   file from some other source.

       Input:

         None

   Output:

         Pointer to a string containing the Path/Filename of the Digital
         Palette configuration file.

 DP_Sleep()

     Summary:

         void DP_Sleep(num)

         DP_Sleep(num) will "sleep" for num seconds.  This routine calls the
         routine WaitForTicks() which uses the DOS time of day interrupt to
         count clock ticks until it is time to "wake up."  If this is not
         appropriate for your application, for example running under multi-
         tasking environment, you should modify this routine.

       Input:

         int num           Number of seconds to sleep.

   Output:

         None

 DP_FileOpen()

     Summary:

         void DP_FileOpen(DP_DATA *dp, char *FileName)

         DP_FileOpen(dp, FileName) uses ANSI C function fopen() for read
         access and stores the file pointer in structure dp as macro
         DP_FILE_POINTER(dp) which is a union member of type FILE.

         If you modify this routine to open the file with a low-level open
         which uses int file handles, then store the handle in macro
         DP_FILE_HANDLE(dp).

         example:
            DP_FILE_HANDLE(dp) = open(FileName, OS_SPECIFIC_READ_MODE) ; 

       Input:

         DP_DATA    *dp    Pointer to Digital Palette Toolkit data structure
                           which is defined in the DPALETTE.H include file.

         char *FileName    Name of the file to open.

   Output:

         Return zero if success, non-zero if error.
