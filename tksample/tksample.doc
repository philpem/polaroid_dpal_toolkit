This document describes the source and executable programs in this
directory. Most are sample programs which USE the toolkit.

It is safe to run any of these programs.  Just type their name and they
will tell you about any command line arguments.

!!! The .EXEs assume that IMAGEPRINT has already been installed !!!

Complete C source is provided.  The sources are compiled for MS-DOS
using Microsoft C compiler, version 5.1.  You will find the .OBJs and .EXEs
on the disk.  There is a Microsoft compatible makefile supplied if you
wish to recompile the sources yourself.

If you are writing a driver for the Digital Palette filmprinter....
    You can use these as starting points for your driver. There is also
    a program (mkerror.exe) which you can run to generate some wierd errors
    in the Digital Palette filmprinter to test how that driver responds
    correctly.

If you are porting the Toolkit to another environment, e.g. OS/2 or UNIX...
    You can use these programs as a validation suite.  You should be able
    to run most of these programs on the ported toolkit.  There is also a
    program (bdparm.exe) which generates all kinds of illegal calls into the
    toolkit and verifies that the toolkit responds properly.  There
    is also a program (timeit.exe) will measure how fast you can send data
    to the Digital Palette.

The sample programs (Use these as an example):
    apic.[exe,c]        Takes one picture - most elementry program here
                          Look at this first.
    tkstat.[exe,c]      Inquires the Film Printer of all it "knows" and 
                          displays it on the screen.  Doesn't take a
                          picture.
    tkfilm.[exe,c]      Inquires the Film Printer for film information and
                          displays it on the screen.  Doesn't take a picture.
    aspect.[exe,c]      Shows how to choose resolution to preserve aspect
                          ratio.  Shoot a picture of a circle.
    npics.[exe,c]       Shows how to batch a bunch of pictures.  Takes several
                          pictures and demonstrates how to render and send
                          data to the film printer simultaneously.
    backg.[exe,c]       Shoots a picture with a swept background.  Also
                          demonstrates how to load a color table if your
                          application uses less than 24 bits of color.
    mosaic.[exe,c]      Shoots several images on a single piece of film.
	tldnld.[exe,c]		Downloads a film table to the palette.


Test programs (Use these to test your driver or port):
    mkerror.[exe,c]     NOT PORTABLE.  REQUIRES A CENTRONICS CONNECTION.
                        Run it to generate any one of 4 errors.  Then
                        follow the instructions on how to test your
                        driver's response.  Just say "mkerror" to get
                        a full set of instructions.
    bdparm.[exe,c]      Makes a lot of illegal calls into the Toolkit and
                        verifies that Toolkit responds properly.
    timeit.[exe,c]      Times the transmission of data from the host to
                        the filmprinter.
