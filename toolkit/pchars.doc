    Pchar1.exe and Pchar2.exe are used to download commands and data from
    DOS to the Digital Palette.

Usage (where N = port#)

        With no arguments this utility displays the status of the port N in
        hexidecimal.  (See port status description below.)

        With arguments, PcharN displays the initial status of the port plus
        the status of the port after each byte of data has been sent.

PcharN  $  c  c  n  n  bytes...
        |  |  |  |  |    |
        |  |  |  |  |    data byte values (number of bytes = byte count)
        |  |  |  |  MSB of byte count (in decimal)
        |  |  |  LSB of byte count (in decimal)
        |  |  Second byte of Digital Palette command
        |  First byte of Digital Palette command
        $ translates to Escape (hex 1b)

    Example to abort an exposure in progress from DOS to a Digital Palette
    connected to LPT2:

Pchar2 $ A B 0 0

initial status 90
pchar pstat $ 90
pchar pstat A 90
pchar pstat B 90
pchar pstat 0 90
